# I'm Liam

I'm a Comp Sci (also Linguistics and Spanish) student who plays around with many languages (programming and human/spoken)

Currently I'm diving deeper and deeper into Zig and having a lot of fun

(_I was all-in on Rust for a while, but the language is hard and I need a bit of a break, I will return to it though_)
> (_I have Luca Palmieri's [`Zero to Production in Rust`](https://www.zero2prod.com) sitting on my desk_)

### Programming Languages:

- Rust (My most-used by far)
- Zig (May overtake my Rust use... we'll see)
- Java (College, kept off of github)
- C++ (College and other, kept off of github)
- C (Mostly maintaining my DWM fork)
- Python (Self-taught, and the only one I've committed to any production system, mostly not on github)
- Lua (Mostly scripts for the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft... kept those on Pastebin)



### Spoken Languages:

- English (Native)
- Spanish (Fluent)
- Irish (School + self-taught, I like to think pretty fluent)
- Japanese (Low-level conversational)
