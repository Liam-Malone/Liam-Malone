# I'm Liam

Currently I'm diving into Zig and having a lot of fun

### Programming Languages:

- Rust
- Zig
- Java
- C++
- C
- Python
- Lua


### Spoken Languages:

- English (Native)
- Spanish (Fluent)
- Irish (School + self-taught, I like to think pretty fluent)
- Japanese (Low-level conversational)
