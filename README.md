***I keep configs/forks I use personally up here.***

**Copy if you like.**

I like rust. I like it a lot.

<p>Got any recommendations for tweaks to the configs/forks I keep up here? </p>
<p>If it's a functionality thing, I'd love to hear it. </p>
<p>If it's just personal preference... I mean why not, lemme know. </p>
