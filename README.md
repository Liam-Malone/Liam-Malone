I keep configs/forks I use personally up here.
Copy if you like.

As far as languages I can use:
- Python
- Rust
- Bash scripting
- C
- Lua
.... that list continues on. I'm not a master in any of those, but I program enough to adapt to whatever language I need to use.

Got any recommendations for tweaks to the configs/forks I keep up here? 
If it's a functionality thing, I'd love to hear it. 
If it's just personal preference... I mean why not, lemme know.
